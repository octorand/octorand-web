                        Octorand is a unique virtual world exclusively inhabited by beings known as Primes. The
                        characteristics and abilities of Primes are governed by OCTO, the native currency of this
                        digital realm.

                        Each Prime in Octorand is an Algorand NFT, uniquely represented by an Algorand ASA and an
                        Algorand Smart Contract. Primes exist in two generations, the first generation consists of 1000
                        Primes, each of which produced 8 offspring, resulting in 8000 second generation Primes. The two
                        generations of Primes differ in several ways, with the first generation typically being more
                        costly to manage compared to the second generation.

                        OCTO, represented by an Algorand ASA, is the native currency of Octorand and features unique
                        deflationary dynamics. As a versatile utility token, OCTO serves numerous applications across
                        the Octorand ecosystem. With an initial finite supply of 1,000,000 tokens, the total amount of
                        OCTO gradually decreases over time as it is utilized for various functions within Octorand.
