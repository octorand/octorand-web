                        In Octorand, Primes reign supreme as the sole inhabitants. Initially, 1000 Primes graced this
                        realm, but as time unfolded, each of these first generation Primes gave birth to 8 offspring,
                        leading to the emergence of 8000 Primes in the second generation.

                        Primes are a dynamic and ever-evolving species. They have the unique ability to transform
                        themselves under the influence of their owners. To facilitate these evolutions, Primes
                        require OCTO tokens.

                        OCTO token is the native currency of Octorand. Every Prime started its life with a bundle of
                        OCTO token rewards hidden within. They graciously allow their owners to extract these OCTO token
                        bundles from them.

                        OCTO tokens used for Prime evolutions are instantly burned, gradually reducing the OCTO token
                        supply over time. This process leads to the eventual finality of Prime evolutions.
